This challenge will help you learn the concept of recursion.

A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. 
The C programming language supports recursion. But while using recursion, 
one needs to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.

To prevent infinite recursion, if else statement (or similar approach) can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and other doesn't.

code :

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
//Complete the following function.

int find_nth_term(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
  //Write your code here.
  int n1,n2,n3,sum,i;
  for(i=0;i<3;i++){
      n=n-1;
      if(n=c){
       sum=sum+c;
      }else if(n=b){
          sum=sum+b;
      }else if(n=a){
          sum=sum+a;
      }else{
          sum=n;
      }
      
        
      }

  return sum;
}

int main() {
    int n, a, b, c;
  
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &n, &a, &b, &c);
    int ans = find_nth_term(n, a, b, c);
 
    printf("%d", ans); 
    return 0;
}
