In this challenge, you will learn to implement the basic functionalities of pointers in C.
A pointer in C is a way to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). 
They are primarily used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable, of which it doesn't have ownership.

In order to access the memory address of a variable, val , we need to prepend it with & sign.
E.g., &val returns the memory address of val .

code :

#include <stdio.h>

void update(int *a,int *b) {
    // Complete this function 
    int sum,sub;
    sum=*a+*b;
    sub=*a-*b;
    sub=abs(sub);
    *a=sum;
    *b=sub;
    return *a;
    return *b;
}

int main() {
    int a, b;
    int *pa = &a, *pb = &b;
    
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    update(pa, pb);
    printf("%d\n%d", a, b);

    return 0;
}
